# PortfolioRiskAssessment
This python program allows for the user to input their stock holdings, including tickers, number of shares, and Dollar-Cost-Average (DCA), and automatically fetches current stock prices to calculate the portfolio's current value. It also computes key risk metrics such as annual return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, Value at Risk (VaR), and Conditional VaR (CVaR). The program also performs Monte Carlo simulations to project the future of the portfolio's value over a user-specified number of years and then generates a graph displaying the worst-case (5th percentile), median (50th percentile), and best-case (95th percentile) scenarios. Additionally, it outputs a detailed TXT report summarizing all holdings, risk metrics, and simulation results.

In the future, I plan to enhance the program by including dividends and reinvestment calculations, rescot and industry exposure analysis, confidence inteerval shading on graphs, portfolio opitmization features such as maximum Sharpe ratio and minimum volatility allocations, and an interactive dashboard interface using Streamlit for a more user friendly experience.
